# Passive-Learning-For-Time-Series-Forecasting
In this project, I explored the power of passive learning techniques in predicting future trends and patterns in time series data. By leveraging historical information and adopting a data-driven approach, I developed a robust forecasting model that can make accurate predictions for various time-dependent scenarios.
